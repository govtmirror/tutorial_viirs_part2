## Commerce Data Usability Project
####VIIRS Nighttime Imagery for Socioeconomic Indicators: Even months
######Lead: Star Ying, Data Scientist, Commerce Data Service

Note: This is parallel project to the "odd months" project in which two teams of Commerce Data Service data scientists are independently producing models to evaluate the objective. 

####> intro
Everyday, the VIIRS instrument on the Suomi NPP Satellite mission collects near visible infrared imagery along a Polar orbit. The utility of the data is boundless. Using nighttime imagery, there are potential applications for tracking/quantifing various aspects of life around the globe, from economy to energy use. The key, however, is to process various publicly available data sources into a format that can be 'mashed up'.

####> objective
Using various pattern detection methods, train and evaluate models against hundreds of county-level, monthly-level statistics to assess the feasibility of monitoring key metrics for near real-time tracking.

####> milestones
- **November 2015**: 
  - Initial data collection using VIIRS monthly composites, discussions with NOAA
  - Collection of multiple county level data sources from the Census Bureau, Bureau of Labor Statistics, Energy Information Administration
  - Iterative model training 
- **December 2015**:
  - Reveal first findings, discussions on production possibilities
